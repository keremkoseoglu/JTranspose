JTranspose
==========

JTranspose is a program to help you transpose musical chords. Just paste your chords into the window, select how many steps you want to transpose, and that's it! All chords will be automatically transposed to the key you want.

I have developed this program for personal purposes, and decided to publish it because fellow musicians may find it useful. Transposing complex songs is not the most entertaining task in the music industry. Young programmers may find it useful as well - it demonstrates a sample of using circular lists.

The program was written in Java (Netbeans) on Mac OS X Snow Leopard. Mac users can simply double-click the .JAR file to execute the program. Windows users are going to have to type "java -jar JTranspose.jar" within the command prompt.
